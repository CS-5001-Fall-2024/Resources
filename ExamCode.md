# Recommended Approach to Submitting Code on Canvas

Your exam will include questions that require you to submit code. You may use VS
Code to develop your solution; however, if you copy/paste your code into the
Canvas text box the formatting will be lost.

I will be lenient on grading of indentation, but it is recommended that you use
the following approach to submitting your code on Canvas.

1. Develop your solution in VS Code.
2. Copy/paste your solution into the **Source code:** box at the website
   [http://hilite.me/](http://hilite.me/).
3. Select the "Highlight!" button. This will generate HTML code that will appear
   in the **HTML:** box on the website.
4. Copy the HTML code from the **HTML:** box.
5. At the bottom of the Canvas answer box, select the </> icon. The answer box
   will turn grey and will expect you to enter HTML code.
6. Paste the HTML code into the answer box.
7. Select the </> icon again. 
8. You have submitted nicely formatted and highlighted code!
